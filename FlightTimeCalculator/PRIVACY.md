# Privacy Policy
Last updated: 10 September, 2019

The Flight Time Calculator mobile application (the "App") was built by Manne Hedlund ("I", "my") as an Open Source project. The App is provided by Manne Hedlund at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This section aims to inform you of my policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information in the App.

The collection of personal information collected in the App plays a key role in providing the core functionality of the App.

**By using the App you agree to the collection and use of your information in relation to this policy as well as the [Google Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy).**

## Information, Collection and Use
When using the App, you may directly provide the following flight information.

Departure airport(s), departure date(s), departure time(s), arrival airport(s), arrival date(s) and arrival time(s).

This information can be entered via text inputs that exist throughout the user interface. All information provided by the user will be retained on the user's device and not collected by me in any way.

The geographical coordinates of any provided airports, along with any provided date and time information, may be used in requests to the Google Time Zone API, as part of the Google Maps API. In such cases, Google may receive access to the information.

## Security
No method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure and reliable, and so I cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information you provide.

## Changes
I reserve the right to modify my privacy policy at any time, effective upon posting an updated version here.
In such a case, the last updated date found above will be revised.
Continued use of the App after any such changes shall constitute your consent to said changes.

## Contact
If you have any questions about my privacy policy, please send me an email at manne.jag@gmail.com.
